                        My name is Claire. And yellow is my favorite color. Hence, I just made up a silly title for my personal website as "Yellow C". It has nothing much of an in-depth meaning. It just came up as a tiny bulb in my little brain to name it after my favorite color and my first name's first letter. Just as plain as that. And yeah, I have a cat!

                        My name is Katzilla. I love to go outside and sniff fresh green grasses. And I eat them too! They taste so good, I promise. I love organic stuff. Other than that, I also like to eat fruit-flavored yogurt. I don't eat that much but they say I am fat and ugly. Whatever! I scratch and pounce on them whenever I can anyway just for fun and entertainment! Peace humans! Feed me some yogurt please...

                        I have some few flowers and veggies like sunflower, black eyed susan, squash, tomatatoes, peppers, okra, eggplant, lemon grass, corn, garlic, onions, and some few others. I just have to deal with wild animals messing up with the plants every now and then. Sometimes, they take it all when I'm not too quick to get my share.

                        I enjoy cooking too. I love food which are spicy, a little hot but not too hot that I couldn't eat it at all. I always add extra spices to my dishes so it would fit my taste. I also love to experiment on how to spice up what I cook like mixing up some other spices together and see how it improves the taste (or sometimes I ruin it too, lol!). But overall, cooking is fun and entertaining!

                        I love to code and build things. I enjoy working with and manipulating data. Programming is fun and can be frustrating too. But the eureka moment always surpasses the amount of frustration I experienced. But hey, I'm just a noob!
